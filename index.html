            <h3> 5 reasons why this game is my favorite:</h3>
		This is the first game I ever play when I got my ps4. It is the game where I can actually relax and have fun. It has introduced me to my favorite weapon to use when I play games the Bow. I like the machines it has introduced me to as nearly all of them have different behaviours like the shell-walker, Its main goal is to protect crates from enemies craving for the things inside, this has gave me an interest in robotics. And it has a special place in my heart for the memories it ha made for me.
